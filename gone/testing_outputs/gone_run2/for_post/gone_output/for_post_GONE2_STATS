# PREPROCESSING INFORMATION:
# Temporal Ne estimation using unphased diploid data under the assumption of
#   a single population model with panmixia.
# The marker locations in a physical map are known and the chromosome sizes and the
#   total genome size will be calculated using those locations. The physical map will be
#   converted into a genetic map using a constant recombination rate across the genome: 
#   distances in Morgans will be calculated using the physical distances (in Mb).
# Ne will be inferred using the recombination rates between loci and the weighted cuadratic
#   correlations of alleles of loci pairs.
# The complete theoretical model will be used to search for the historical Ne series
#   that best fit the the observed correlations across bins of recomination.
