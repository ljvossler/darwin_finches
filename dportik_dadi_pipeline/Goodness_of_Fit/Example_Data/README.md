**Example Input File**

The SNPs input file *dadi_2pops_North_South_snps.txt* will run with the *Simulate_and_Optimize.py* script, as long as the file path is changed in the script to reflect its location on your computer. 

These data come from:

+ Charles, K.C., Bell, R.C., Blackburn, D.C., Burger, M., Fujita, M.K., Gvozdik, V., Jongsma, G.F.M., Leache, A.D., and D.M. Portik. 2018.

**Example Outputs**

The *Example_Outputs* folder contains example output files generated by running the *Simulate_and_Optimize.py* script. 
Note that these outputs were generated with only five simulations and a very short optimization routine, 
rather than what is coded in the *Simulate_and_Optimize.py* script, and the settings in the 
*Simulate_and_Optimize.py* script should be used for production level analyses.
